-viewVersion tests: 
/vcp -viewVersion [insert]

Version3_textfile.txt // if only 2 versions exists
VErsion2_textfile.txt // test mix of capital and noncapital letters
Vwrsion4_textfile.txt // test if error handling catches mispelling and invalid version #
Version_textfile.txt // test if error handling catches when no version # is added
Version1_teeeee.c    // Handle if teeee.c doesn't exist (invalid file name)
.c, .txt, .md // save different files (must have .[file extension])

-listVersions tests:
/vcp -listVersions [insert]

Version3_textfile.txt  // only takes filename not version numbers (access directory not direct file ver)
textfile // handling no extension and invalid entry


-saveVersion tests: 
/vcp -saveVersion [insert]

Version3_textfile.txt // saves current file state, not specific version that already is saved in directory
textfile.c // normal entry
idontexist.c // enter a file that doesn't exist

General Testing:
Check if too many args are provided
Check if too few args are provided
Check if invalid flags are provided
Saved long files like lab with broken.c
Saved short files and medium files like getlinetest.txt
Saved txt, c, md files etc

Only inside QEMU using echo can you test multiple versions of saving, viewing, listing due to limitations of xv6
If files are in os-[insert your id] and specified in makefile correctly, inside qemu you can save a version of that 
outside file however, any changes made back outside QEMU will not be reflected when trying to save it again in QEMU
due to xv6 limitations. It will save the past file version again and populate it as version 2 which can be used with 
all flags as normal but again due to the limitations of xv6, the new changes will not be seen in QEMU thus the reason
for echo to test the actual changes being saved and overwritten accordingly.
